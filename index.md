# Getting started

Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language to solve combinatorial problems.
With our tools you can concentrate on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it.
[Get started!](/start/)

To get a quick first impression, you may want to experiment with [running clingo](/clingo/run/) in your browser.

# Documentation

A comprehensive documentation of our software can be found in the [Potassco guide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/).
For additional resources, see the [documentation](/doc/) page.

# Systems

To find out more about a specific system and a download link, follow one of the links below.

* [**clingo**](/clingo/) an ASP system to ground and solve logic programs.
    * [**gringo**](/clingo/) is a grounder (powering the grounding in clingo) for logic programs with *first-order* variables.
    * [**clasp**](/clasp/) is a solver (powering the search in clingo) for *propositional* (extended) normal and disjunctive logic programs.

# Labs

The [Labs](/labs/) suite comprises programs related to Answer Set Programming.
These are either small utilities or projects in an early or unfinished development phase.
