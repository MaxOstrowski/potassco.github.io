summary: A system to compute finite models of first-order theories.
---
fmc2iasp is a system for computing finite models of first-order theories
(written in [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) format)
via incremental Answer Set Programming.
fmc2iasp uses [iclingo](/cemetery/#iclingo) for finding answer sets of the resulting logic program.
An answer set represents a finite model of the input theory.
