title: xorro
summary: Calculate a set of relevant answer sets using XOR constraints.
---
Inspired by similar approaches in the field of Boolean satisfiability, the tool xorro exploits XOR constraints to calculate samples with near uniform distribution.
Hence, it allows for calculating a few answer sets representative for all answer sets of a logic program.
This is particularly useful if the computation of all answer sets is practically infeasible.
