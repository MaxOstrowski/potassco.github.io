summary: A system for translating flatzinc csp files into the aspif intermediate format to be read with clingcon.
---
fz2aspif translates [flatzinc](http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-1.6/flatzinc-spec.pdf) files into ground aspif files to be used with [clingcon](/clingcon/).
As clingcon currently only supports linear and distinct constraints,
fz2aspif provides the translation descriptions for [mzn2fzn](http://www.minizinc.org/software.html) here: [share/clingcon](https://github.com/potassco/fz2aspif/tree/master/share/clingcon).
Use [mzn2fzn](http://www.minizinc.org/software.html) as described in the [README](https://github.com/potassco/fz2aspif/blob/master/README)
to convert minizinc csp files into flatzinc files compatible with fz2aspif.
