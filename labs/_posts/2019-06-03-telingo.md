Telingo is a solver for temporal programs. It leaverages clingo's input
language and scripting cababilities to parse and solve programs with temporal
formulas. As such, the input of telingo is valid clingo input supporting all of
clingo's language features, like for example aggregates; only the way programs
are grounded and solved is adjusted.
