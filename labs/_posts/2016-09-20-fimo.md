fimo is a system for computing finite models of first-order theories
(written in [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) format)
via incremental Answer Set Programming.
fimo uses [iclingo](/clingo/) for finding answer sets of the resulting logic program.
An answer set represents a finite model of the input theory.
