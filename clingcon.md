clingcon is an answer set solver for constraint logic programs,
building upon the answer set solver clingo.
It extends the high-level modeling language of ASP with constraint solving capacities.
Constraints over finite domain integer variables can be used in logic programs.
clingcon adopts state-of-the-art techniques from the area of SMT,
like conflict-driven learning and theory propagation.
