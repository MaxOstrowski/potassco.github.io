summary: A software collection for biological applications.
---
The BioASP software collection includes applications for analyzing metabolic, signaling and gene regulatory networks, 
consistency checking, diagnosis, and repair of biological data and models. They allow for computing 
predictions and generating hypotheses about required extensions of biological models, as well as designing 
new experiments and finding intervention strategies to control the biological system at hand.
