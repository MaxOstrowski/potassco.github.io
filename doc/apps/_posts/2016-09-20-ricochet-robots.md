title: Ricochet Robots
summary: Encodings to solve the ricochet robots game.
---
Alex Randolph's board game Ricochet Robots offers a rich and versatile benchmark for
ASP. As it stands, it represents a simple multi-agent planning problem in which each
agent, i.e., robot, has limited sensing capacities (that is, only bumps are detected).

The Ricochet Robots visualization tool robotviz allows for displaying the board with
barriers, robots, and targets as well as for animating robot moves in a stepwise fashion.

Note that the clingo examples (part of the [releases](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases)) also contain an encoding and a visualizer for the ricochet robot problems.
