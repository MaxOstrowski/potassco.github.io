Current answer set solvers work on variable-free programs.
Hence, a grounder is needed that, given an input program with first-order variables, computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program.
gringo is such a grounder.
Its output can be processed further with [clasp](/clasp/), [claspfolio](/labs/claspfolio/), or [clingcon](/clingcon/).

clingo combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system.
This way it offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.

Both clingo and gringo are released together in one package.

**Attention!** The languages of clingo 3 and 4 are not fully compatible because clingo 4 adheres to the recent [ASP language standard][aspcore].
For processing legacy encodings, we recommend downloading the latest version of clingo 3 in addition to clingo 4.
The language did not change in version 5 but there were many API changes.

- The [clorm] python library provides an object relational mapper-like interface to clingo.
  It allows facts to be asserted and extracted in an intuitive and easy to use way.
- The [clingo-rs] project provides rust bindings to the clingo library.
- The [clingo-haskell] project provides haskell bindings to the clingo library.
- There are also rudimentary [prolog bindings][clingo-pl] to clingo.
