The program ASPeRiX is an implementation of the stable model semantics for
normal logic programs.  The main specifity of our system is to realize a
forward chaining of first order rules that are grounded on the fly. So, unlike
others available ASP systems, ASPeRiX does not need a pregrounding processing.
