Potassco, the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection, bundles tools for Answer Set Programming developed at the [University of Potsdam](https://uni-potsdam.de).

Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language to solve combinatorial problems.
With our tools you can concentrate on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it.

Our systems won shiny awards in different competitions.
Check out our [trophy page](/trophies/).
