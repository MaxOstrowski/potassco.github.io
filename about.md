Potassco, the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection, bundles tools for Answer Set Programming developed at the University of Potsdam.

Answer Set Programming (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language to solve combinatorial problems.
With our tools you can concentrate on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it.
